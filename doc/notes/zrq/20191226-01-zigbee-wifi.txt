    Different networks

        WiFi
        Zigbee
        433MHz

    Most of the applications and appliances use WiFi or Zigbee.

    Best option for integrating WiFi is to use MQTT
    http://mqtt.org/

    "MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol."

    OpenSource integration service
    https://www.home-assistant.io/

    Zigbee2mqtt bridge links Zigbee to MQTT.

        USB stick version
        https://www.phoscon.de/en/conbee

        Comes with it's own software, deCONZ, which aseems to be a binary blob.

        REST service ontop of deCONZ

        Docker container with deCONZ installed
        https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/docker-deconz


    Most people seem to be prefer CC2531 and Zigbee2MQTT, but it is more expensive than WiFi.

    Tasmota
        "Tasmota is an alternative firmware for ESP8266 based devices like iTead Sonoff,
        offering web and OTA (Over The Air) firmware updates and sensors support, which
        can be controlled under Http, Serial, MQTT and KNX, allowing for an easy integration
        with Smart Home Systems."
    https://tasmota.github.io/
    https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota

        Firmware to convert ESP8266 based devices to use MQTT.
        Cool, but why not use Zigbee devices to start with ?

        Because in cases like SONOFF, the WiFi version is cheaper and easier to get.

        https://templates.blakadder.com/magichome_ZJ-WFMN-A_RGBW.html
        Guess is we could buy the WiFi version, and use Tasmota to control it.

        "A collection of scripts to flash Tuya IoT devices to alternative firmwares"

        "VTRUST and the German tech magazine c't decided to work together. Since reflashing
        devices using the ESP8266/85 is widespread among DIY smart home enthusiasts, we
        wanted to provide an easy way for everyone to free their devices from the cloud

        Using their offer is dead-simple, since everything can be done by clicking through the Tuya
        web page, from choosing your pre-designed products or pre-programmed wifi-modules (mostly ESP8266)
        to building your own app."

        "Tuya devices are sold under numerous brand names but they're all identifiable by the
        fact that they connect with these phone apps: "Smart Life" or "Tuya Smart".
        They incorporate different types of Tuya Wi-Fi modules internally."
